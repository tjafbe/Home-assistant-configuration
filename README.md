# Home-assistant-configuration

This is merely a selective archive of my main home assistant configuration and dashboards. My configuration is not particularly well structured. I use a mix of includes and packages whihc doesn't help. Some day I might decide to clean up and use only packages.

For my dashboards, be aware that I use a lot of custom components.
